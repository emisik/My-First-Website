Phase 1: Planning
Use the tool of your choice to draw the layout of each of your pages. Once you're satisfied with your design, go through and mark the appropriate HTML tags for each item on each page.

At this point, make decisions for the look and feel of your site. Select at most two different fonts - one for text and one for headers. Pick your color palette and write down hex codes. If you aren't very artistic, there are lots of tools on the internet that can help with this! Just search for "website color palette generator".

Don't write any CSS just yet, but organize these graphical elements into classes, and mark which class goes with each HTML element. For example:

H1 headers
Font:  Arial, strong, large
Font color: #B7B6C1
Text underlined with color #94958bs
Phase 2: Construction
After you've completed your site, start building! Before you write a single line of CSS, you should complete all of your HTML. There are two reasons for this strategy. First, it lets you focus on one language at a time. Shifting back and forth between languages is difficult for experienced developers. When you're first learning, it's even harder to "load" and "unload" different languages or technologies into your brain without becoming overwhelmed.

Second, it's much more efficient to handle style and layout after you've put everything onto the page. Otherwise, you'll find yourself spending a large amount of time perfecting and beautifying an element, only to find out that it doesn't fit, doesn't match, or can't be aligned with something else.

After the HTML is done, test it thoroughly to make sure that all the links work.

Phase 3: Styling
With your site feature and content complete, now is the time to make it pretty!

Using your planning work as a guide, write CSS classes to handle the layout and style of the elements on each of your pages. Try to be efficient, but don't worry too much about re-using or not re-using your code. The most important thing to focus on is organization and clarity. Apply what you've learned so far to use classes or selectors to apply each style to each element in a way that would be obvious to another developer when they look at your code.
